    #### Walking?

    Steps from your door are dozens of great restaurants, whale watching tours, kayak adventures, the farmer's market, boat rentals, the Whale Museum, a renowned local theater, art galleries, unique local shops, and so much more. 
    
    If you want to explore the island (without a car), the Jolly Trolley (a hop-on, hop-off bus), an island bus, and taxis are right outside your Ferry Landing Suites front door.
